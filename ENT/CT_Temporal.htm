              <p>At the most inferior level we see the facial nerve 
passing inferiorly to finally reach the stylomastoid foramen (not shown 
in this image).<br>
The carotid artery is shown  within the carotid canal.<br>
Also at this level is the top of the jugular bulb.</p>

              <p>At this level we can see the manubrium of the malleus (yellow arow) anterior to the long process of the incus.<br>
The round window is indicated by the blue arrow.<br>
The round window dissipates the pressure generated by the fluid 
vibrations within the cochlea and thus serves as a release valve.</p>

              <p>The base of the stapes rocks in and out against the oval window.<br>

              <p>Within the cochlea the movement of the hair cells 
convert the sound-vibrations into nerve impulses, that  travel over the 
cochlear nerve to the auditory cortex of the brain, which interprets the
 impulses as sound. . <br>
The head of the malleus is seen anterior to the head of the incus (yellow arrow).

parallel to the wall of the epitympanum.<br>
The head of the malleus (yellow arrow) is seen anterior to the head and the short process of the incus.

              <p>At this level the aditus ad antrum is seen. This is the connection between the tympanic cavity and the antrum.<br>
The labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve coming from the internal 
auditory canal angles sharply forward, nearly at right angles to the 
long axis of the petrous bone, to reach the geniculate ganglion. <br>
At the ganglion the facial nerve makes a U-turn (first genu of the 
facial nerve) to run posteriorly as the tympanic segment along the 
medial wall of the epitympanum.<br></p>

              <p>At this level the antrum is seen surrounded by smaller mastoid aircells just lateral to the superior semicircular canals . <br>
The three semicircular canals lie perpendicular to each other to sense 
acceleration and deceleration movements in each of the 3 spatial planes.
  <br>
Static head position is sensed by the vestibule, which contains the position hair cells.  <br>
Different head positions produce different gravity effects by small 
calcium carbonate particles (otoliths) on these hair cells.  <br></p>

          <h2>Coronal anatomy</h2>

              <p>The petrous bone is positioned in an oblique orientation from posterolateral to anteromedial.<br>
As a result most structures will be sectioned obliquely on coronal images.<br>
The following coronal images go from anterior to posterior.<br>
First we will see the tympanic membrane with the ossicles, followed by the cochlea, antrum and semicircular canalls.<br>
Finally the most posterior image will show the point where the facial nerve exits the temporal bone at the stylomastoid foramen.</p>

              <h3 id="i443f900fb7f83">Scutum</h3>
              <p>The scutum (yellow arrow) is a sharp bony spur formed 
by the lateral wall of the tympanic cavity and the superior wall of the 
external auditory canal.<br>
It is usually the first bony structure to erode as a result of a 
cholesteatoma, that is formed by medial retraction of the pars flaccida 
of the tympanic membrane into the epitympanum.<br>
If the retraction continues it will result in ossicular destruction. <br>
If the cholesteatoma passes posteriorly through the aditus ad antrum 
into the mastoid itself, erosion of the tegmen mastoideum, with exposure
 of the dura and erosion of the lateral semicircular canal with deafness
 and vertigo, may result. </p>
              <p>On the left the most anterior point of the facial nerve is seen (white arrow). <br>
At this point the nerve makes a U-turn.<br>
It is named the genu or geniculum and represents the geniculate ganglion.<br>
The malleus is seen connected to the tympanic membrane and to the incus.</p>

              <br />Coronal reconstruction clearly 
demonstates that the incus (I) is positioned posterolateral to the 
malleolar head (H).On the axial image the short crus of the incus is 
seen pointing posterolaterally.
            
            
              <p>In many illustrations you will see the incus connecting medially to the malleus, but this is not correct.<br>
On the coronal reconstruction on the left it is clearly demonstated that
 the incus is positioned posterolaterally to the malleolar head.<br>
The long crus of the incus subsequently runs inferomedially to the stapes.</p>
